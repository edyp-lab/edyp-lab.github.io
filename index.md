Welcome to the [EDyP](https://edyp.fr){:target="_blank"} laboratory computation proteomics projects website, which contains the software projects
developed and maintained by the EDyP members. Here is a list of software developed in our lab. For each of them you can find links to source code repository, documentation or downloads 

### ProstaR
 
A R/Shiny application dedicated to the differential analysis of quantitative data resulting from discovery proteomics experiments  
See [ProstaR pages](pages/prostar) or  [ProstaR site](https://www.prostar-proteomics.org/){:target="_blank"}

### Proline

A software environment for analysis of mass spectrometry based proteomics data to organize, collect,  validate, quantify, visualize and publish proteomics datasets.  
See [Proline pages](pages/proline) or  [Proline site](http://www.profiproteomics.fr/proline){:target="_blank"}

### MzScope

Display and navigate MS data from mzdb files.  
See [MzScope page](pages/mzScope)

### Mzdb converter

Converts raw files from various mass spectrometer manufacturers into mzdb files.  
See [file format utils pages](pages/mzdbConverter)

### MGFBoost

MGFBoost extract peaklists from raw MS data in mzdb format prior to search engine submission for peptide identification.  
See [MGFBoost pages](pages/mgfBoost)

### ePims

A LIMS dedicated to mass spectrometry data.  
See [ePims pages](pages/ePims) : **TO BE DONE**

## Tools

A set of usefully tools is also defined through few repositories.  
A list with description is accessible on [Tools pages](pages/Tools.md)   **TO BE DONE**
