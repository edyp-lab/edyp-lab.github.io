Welcome on the [EDyP](https://edyp.fr){:target="_blank"}  lab forge, which contains the software projects developed and maintained by the EDyP team. Below is a list of software developed in our team. For each of them you can find links to source code repository, documentation or downloads 

## ProstaR
 
A software tool dedicated to the differential analysis of quantitative data resulting from discovery proteomics experiments  
See [ProstaR pages](pages/ProstaR.md) or  [ProstaR site](https://www.prostar-proteomics.org/){:target="_blank"}

## Proline

An environment for analysis of mass spectrometry based proteomics data to organize, collect,  validate, quantify, visualize and publish proteomics datasets.  
See [Proline pages](pages/Proline.md) or  [Proline site](http://www.profiproteomics.fr/proline){:target="_blank"}

## Mzdb converter

Converts raw file from various mass spectrometer manufacturers into an mzdb file.  
See [file format utils pages](pages/FormatUtil.md)

## MGFBoost

MGFBoost extract peaklists from raw files in mzdb format prior to search engine submission for spectra identification.  
See [Proline pages](pages/Proline.md)

## ePims

A LIMS dedicated to mass spectrometry data.  
See [ePims pages](pages/epims.md) : **TO BE DONE**

## Tools

A set of usefully tools is also defined through few repositories.  
A list with desctiption is accessible on [Tools pages](pages/Tools.md)   **TO BE DONE**
