Since mzDB format support DIA MS data, mzScope also provides MS2 chromatogram extraction within a selected isolation window that can be performed on user supplied m/z values or from ion fragment masses imported from a spectral library. 
Those features combined with the efficiency of the mzDB format make mzScope a suitable tool for MS data visualization and exploration or for raw MS signal comparison.
